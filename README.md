# Non-Newtonian Flow Modeling in Porous Media

Welcome to the **Non-Newtonian Flow Modeling in Porous Media** repository! This project is focused on developing efficient and accurate computational methods for simulating the behavior of non-Newtonian fluids in complex porous structures. By incorporating advanced rheological models, we aim to capture the intricate flow dynamics that are crucial in various geological and engineering applications.

## Key Features

- **Pore Network Modeling**  
  Our code implements pore-scale simulations to study fluid flow through interconnected pores. The approach considers both the geometry of the porous medium and the interactions between different fluid phases.
  For network extraction, please refer to https://github.com/ForoughiSajjad/pnextract.

- **Non-Newtonian Behavior**  
  Unlike Newtonian fluids, which exhibit linear viscosity, polymer fluids generally exhibit the shear-thinning behavior. This repository accommodates a range of non-Newtonian constitutive models to better capture these complex fluid dynamics.

- **Virtual porous media**  
  We use the discrete element method to generate sphere packings, surrogating a wide range of porous media.
